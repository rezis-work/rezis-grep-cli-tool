Beneath the silver willow’s shade,
A gentle breeze in June has played,
It traced the ground with whispered hands,
And hummed its song across the lands.

The drowsy hum of honey bees
Dances along the sleepy trees,
Their golden wings, a silent tune,
Among the petals, soft as moon. 

The river slips past moss and stone,
It keeps its secrets, flows alone,
Reflecting clouds that slowly roam,
Upon their silent journey home.

A hidden fawn in clover deep,
Awakes from its enchanted sleep,
The world is still, the soft wind turns,
And over distant meadows yearns.

An amber dusk, the daylight ebbs,
It lingers long on spider webs,
That shimmer faint beneath the sky,
As evening’s hush begins to sigh.

So breathe beneath the willow’s shade,
Let dreams and longing be unmade,
For night will cradle earth and sea,
And bring you gentle peace, like me.
